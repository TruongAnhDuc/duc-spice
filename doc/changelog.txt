RocketCart v1.3.2

##################
RocketCart v1.3.1
2007-10-17 SVN:1466

This is a large bugfix update for v1.3.0 - with lessons learnt from two new
sites. Changes from v1.3.0 include:

f - Product expiry integrated
f - Password hashing algorithm changing integrated
f - Added phone number field to the Address model
f - Users can now change their passwords in the front-end!
i - Product details page now contains a link to return to the category, to
	hopefully lessen the chance of people using their "back" button.  If
	someone has added something to the cart then uses "back", the browser
	shows its cached version of the cart module without the new product...
i - The appropriate country is now shown in both billing & shipping addresses
	in the checkout
i - If no payment gateway is set up, the order status becomes "in_progress" (I
	have yet to bring across the "orders awaiting payment" screen as it needs
	a tidy way of detecting the payment gateway)
i - 'others also bought' heading is now configurable
i - Added "total" heading to the cart form
i - Product Not Found template added
i - Tables and images re-enabled after a customer enquiry.  If I had the time I
	might put some editor options into the yml config...

b - Category is a required field for Featured Products.
b - Featured Products had their URL's displaying without Category part (which
	was breaking things)
b - Fix for an edge case that came up when a product image was deleted
b - Category pages' weight outputs should respect options to hide weight
	options
b - Exceptions are now handled in the product_images_controller.rb
b - rakelogs.sh script made cron'able
b - Payment Gateway's should be added by default
b - Category ordering fixed (finally - this is an old chestnut). Unit tests for
	Categories have been extended significantly.
b - Phone number shouldn't be a required field in trunk
b - IE6 didn't work with currency conversion
b - Testing for a variable using if() in Javascript is a Bad Idea - undefined
	variables still throw an error :(.
b - Fixed the calendar icon in the orders report
b - Fixed multichoice options in the settings screen
b - Bugfix in search results
b - Removed automatic maxlength setting of floating-point values in the
	settings view, because it doesn't account for non-integer values.
b - DPS module now calculates the order total from the LineItems (the 'total'
	field was dropped from Orders with db migration #14)
b - Fixed address-checking when separate delivery address is used.
b - Emails updated (line of invalid syntax noticed from apache logs)
b - Fixed crash when loading admin settings (Rails 1.1->1.2?)
b - Product names not always appearing in URL's
b - Orders were picking up items from old unfinished orders from same customer
b - Emails were sending twice after an order was placed
b - Emails had $0 amounts displayed for non-totals
d - Table cells were outside their row element
d - Correct height is given to images on the products_overview page.
d - Fixed an IE issue: LI squares are no longer shown in a weird place.

u - The shipping zone editor now uses Javascript instead of Ajax requests, so
	double-clicking the include/exclude buttons won't cause duplicate entries

	bonus it's much more responsive.
u - The admin products listing is now sorted by the product name.

	admin area.
