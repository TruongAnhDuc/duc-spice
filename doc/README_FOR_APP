== Rocket Cart Documentation
v1.2.1, April 10 2007

= Introduction

Rocket Cart has been designed to be a flexible, friendly solution for medium-budget web commerce
applications running on Avatar's Linux server. It is modular, extensible and approachable, with
the idea being that it should be possible for someone to learn as much Ruby as they need simply by
looking at the templates, and without touching any business code.

It is important that any application-specific extensions be either integrated into the core modules
of Rocket Cart, or developed as separate modules in separate source files (for example, by creating
a new controller). In this way, it can be guaranteed that future bug fixes can be rolled out with a
minimum of fuss, simply by copying the relevant files.

      |  +- payments             Rocket Cart payment modules
      |  |  +- rocket-secure     Rocket Secure payment module

      +- script                  Rails configuration scripts
      +- stats
      +- test
      +- vendor

As a rule, anything under the <tt>public</tt> directory is accessible from the main URL: for example,
<tt>/home/rocketcartavatarconz/www/public/stylesheets/local.css</tt> is accessible as <tt>http://rocketcart.avatar.co.nz/stylesheets/local.css</tt>.
Note that the URL must point to an actual file: directory references such as <tt>http://rocketcart.avatar.co.nz/stylesheets/</tt> won't work unless you modify the <tt>.htaccess</tt> file. This isn't really recommended, as you could screw up the way Rails handles URLs.

= Installation

Step-by-step instructions for installation are given at http://rocketcart.avatar.co.nz/new.html.

= Customising Rocket Cart

Most of the work in a Rocket Cart installation is in customising the templates. The main template you need to worry about is the Products layout template (<tt>app/views/layouts/products.rhtml</tt>), as this is used as the base layout for every page in the site. (If there is a template called <tt>app/views/layouts/home.rhtml</tt>, this will be used for the home page instead.) Other templates you might need to customise are:

* Category page template (<tt>app/views/products/category.rhtml</tt>)
* Home page body template (<tt>app/views/products/home.rhtml</tt>)
* Product page template (<tt>app/views/products/product.rhtml</tt>)
* Search page template (<tt>app/views/products/search.rhtml</tt>)
* Cart summary template (<tt>app/views/cart/cart_summary.rhtml</tt>)
* Email templates (in <tt>app/views/postman</tt>)

Any custom CSS rules should go in <tt>public/stylesheets/local.css</tt>, or another file you include from the <tt>products.rhtml</tt> template. <b>Do not</b> modify <tt>admin.css</tt> or <tt>cart.css</tt>, as these are Rocket Cart distribution files.

The code parts of the Rocket Cart templates should be OK left intact: that is, anything between <tt><%</tt> and <tt>%></tt>. If you do need to modify the behaviour of the templates, you'll need to know a bit about Ruby; http://www.rubyonrails.com is a good place to start.

= Database Structure

An up-to-date copy of the database structure was kept at all times in <tt>/home/rocketcartavatarconz/rocketcart.sql</tt>. Recently changes are kept in Rails migrations (see http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/UsingMigrations), allowing data to be updated or even regressed back to old versions as necessary. <tt>/db/schema.rb</tt> has the base schema, and <tt>/db/migrate/*.rb</tt> have the individual migrations. See <tt>/doc/system_uml.png</tt> for an up-to-date overview.
