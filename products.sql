In contrast to green cardamom, which is considered a &lsquo;cooling&rsquo; spice, black cardamom is a &lsquo;heating&rsquo; spice.\r\n<strong>Culinary uses</strong>: Black cardamom is an important ingredient in combination with cloves, cinnamon, and pepper in garam masala and tandoori-style spice mixtures. Black cardamom is also used occasionally in confectionery and pickles. When pods are used whole in vegetable or meat stews they should be removed before serving, but crushed seeds will dissolve into the sauce. The flavour is intense so use sparingly.

This variety constitutes about 75% of the total chilli crop in India, and is cultivated in the states of Tamil Nadu, Andra Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra. These chillies are 5 - 8 cm long and the skin of these chillies is thick, red, and hot. ASTA colour value 32.11, Capsaicin value 0.226%, Scoville (&lsquo;heat&rsquo;) value ranges from 35,000 - 55,000 SHU.\r\n<strong>Native range</strong>: Central America, South America, Caribbean Islands\r\n<strong>Major producers</strong>: India, Thailand, Mexico, USA, South Korea, Turkey, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania\r\n<strong>Harvesting</strong>: Most chillies are grown as annuals and harvesting occurs about 3 months after planting. Green chillies are immature fruits and red chillies have been allowed to ripen for a further 4 weeks. Most of the chilli crop is dried, either in the sun or artificially.\r\n<strong>Taste and aroma</strong>: Chillies range in taste from mild and tingling to explosively hot. Large, fleshy varieties tend to be milder than small, thin-skinned ones. The characteristic pungency of chillies comes from the presence of capsaicin, which stimulates the digestive and circulatory processes.\r\n<strong>Culinary uses</strong>: Chillies can be used whole (fresh or dried), or in crushed or powdered form. Chilli powders are prepared from a variety of mild to hot chillies, and are typically milder than cayenne pepper. Crushed chilli (or chilli flakes) contains both the flesh and seeds from red chillies and can be used instead of chilli powder.\r\n<strong>Other uses</strong>: Oleoresins (a mixture of resin and oil) extracted from chillies contain capsaicin and are used in processed food. Capsaicin has counter-irritant properties and is used in pain balms and liniment. It is also the essential ingredient in pepper sprays used by law enforcement agencies.\r\n<strong>Historical uses</strong>: Use of this hot spice in Mexico is recorded as early as 7000 BC. Christopher Columbus took chilli plants back to Spain and from there they spread to Africa, India, and the Far East, where they quickly became an integral part of each cuisine.\r\n<strong>Storage</strong>: Fresh chillies keep in the refrigerator for a week or more.

It is a dioecious tree, having male and female counterparts, both of which must be cultivated together in order that berries are formed. Juniper berries are the only example of a spice in the botanic group of the coniferae, and also one of the few examples of a spice from cold climatic regions, although the best quality juniper berries come from Southern European countries.\r\n<strong>Native range</strong>: Europe, North America, Asia (juniper has the largest range of any woody plant)\r\n<strong>Major producers</strong>: Italy, Hungary\r\n<strong>Harvesting</strong>: There is some cultivation of juniper but a significant part of the juniper berry harvest is from wild trees which are common on chalky, hilly sites in the northern hemisphere. The purple-black, smooth berries which take about 2 years to ripen are about the size of a small pea, and are typically harvested in the autumn months. The berries are often covered with a greyish powdery substance called &ldquo;bloom&rdquo; which disappears as they ripen.\r\n<strong>Taste and aroma</strong>: The aroma of juniper berries is pleasantly woody with hints of turpentine, and unmistakably like gin. The taste is clean and refreshing with notes of pine, resin, and gin.\r\n<strong>Culinary uses</strong>: Juniper is an important spice in many European cuisines, especially in Alpine regions, where it grows abundantly. It is a key component for the Southern German specialty sauerkraut. Since juniper berries have a strong taste, they should be used sparingly. They are an ideal seasoning for meat stews or marinades for meats (especially game) that are going to be roasted or barbecued. Crushed in a mortar with garlic and rock salt, juniper berries make a tasty rub for lamb, pork, and venison. Crush juniper berries just before using, as their essential oils are quickly lost when in contact with the air.\r\nAlthough juniper berries are harmless for healthy people, their use is discouraged for people with liver and kidney problems, and for pregnant women (as they can cause contractions of the uterus).\r\n<strong>Other uses</strong>: The main use of juniper berries is as a flavouring for gin - in fact, the word &ldquo;gin&rdquo; is derived from the French word for juniper berry, <em>geni&egrave;vre</em>, which is also the name for gin in France. Juniper is a powerful antiseptic and is used in insecticides, soaps, and perfumes. One of the essential oils extracted from juniper berries is widely used in aromatherapy.\r\n<strong>Historical uses</strong>: In the Middle Ages juniper branches were hung over doors as protection against witches, and when burned the branches were thought to keep serpents and snakes at bay. Juniper&rsquo;s use as a flavouring for gin and other spirits dates back at least to the 17th century.\r\n<strong>Storage</strong>: Juniper berries will keep for many months in an airtight container.\r\n','0.00','0.00','0.000',1,'','','','',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',0,0,'0.000'),(39,'MACE WHO','Mace Whole','<strong>Botanical name</strong>: <em>Myristica fragrans</em> â–ª Family name: <em>Myristacaceae</em>\r\nMace and nutmeg are different parts of the same fruit of the nutmeg tree.

The saffron plant is a bulbous, autumn-flowering, perennial of the iris family.\r\n<strong>Native range</strong>: Mediterranean Region, Western Asia\r\n<strong>Major producers</strong>: Spain, Iran, China, Kashmir Region of India.\r\n<strong>Harvesting</strong>: The saffron flowers are carefully harvested by hand at dawn and the three red stigmas plucked from each one. These are toasted, or dried, in sieves over a very low heat to fix the colour. One kilogram of dry saffron needs 500,000 to 1,000,000 stigmas and this, together with the intensive labour required to harvest the crop by hand, accounts for its extremely high price in comparison with other spices. \r\n<strong>Taste and aroma</strong>: The aroma of saffron is rich, pungent, floral, and sometimes with a hint of honey. The aromatic properties vary slightly depending on the saffron&rsquo;s place of origin. The taste is delicate yet penetrating with warm, earthy, musky tones.\r\n<strong>Culinary uses</strong>: Saffron is added to special dishes in many cuisines, often dishes associated with festivals or celebrations. It provides the characteristic flavour for many Mediterranean fish soups and stews of which Provencal bouillabaisse and Catalan zarzuela are the best known. It also provides the characteristic colour of Spanish paella and Italian risotto Milanese.\r\n<strong>Other uses</strong>: Saffron is used in sedatives, as an antispasmodic, and for flatulence. It is also used in perfumes and dyes (including for the robes of Buddhist monks) and, being so expensive, it is considered to be an aphrodisiac in some cultures.\r\n<strong>Historical uses</strong>: Saffron was used by ancient civilisations as a dye and to flavour food and wine.\r\n<strong>Storage</strong>: If stored in an airtight container in a cool, dark place, saffron threads will keep their flavour for 2&ndash;3 years.\r\n','0.00','0.00','0.000',1,'','','','',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',0,0,'0.000'),(51,'STARA WHO','Star Anise Whole','<strong>Botanical name</strong>: <em>Illicium verum</em> â–ª Family name: <em>Magnoliaceae</em>\r\nStar anise is the dried fruit of a small to medium evergreen tree.

Although many attempts were made to introduce the plant elsewhere, vanilla remained exclusive to Mexico and the surrounding region until the 19th century. Vanilla flowers open for only one day and are naturally pollinated by the melipona bee and a particularly long-beaked species of hummingbird, both native to Central America which explained the lack of success in propagation elsewhere. Pollination of the plants in other regions where it is now grown successfully has to be done by hand.\r\n<strong>Native range</strong>: Central America\r\n<strong>Major producers</strong>: Mexico, Madagascar, India, Tahiti, Indonesia, Uganda, West Indies\r\n<strong>Harvesting</strong>: Vanilla pods are harvested when they begin to turn yellow. Further maturation is prevented by plunging them into boiling water. The pods then undergo a long curing process involving controlled heating, drying, and long storage during which the pods shrink to about 20% of their original weight and acquire a dark colour. During this process, enzymes cause a chemical change that produces aromatic compounds, notably vanillin.\r\n<strong>Taste and aroma</strong>: Fresh vanilla pods have no aroma or taste. After fermentation they develop a rich, mellow, intensely perfumed aroma with hints of liquorice. The flavour is delicate and sweetly fruity or creamy, occasionally with hints of raisin or prune.\r\n<strong>Culinary uses</strong>: Vanilla is used almost exclusively in sweet dishes and is a common ingredient in cakes, biscuits, and desserts. Whole or split pods can be used to flavour creams, custards, and ice cream. A whole vanilla pod that has been infused in a syrup or cream can be rinsed, dried, and reused.\r\n<strong>Other uses</strong>: Vanilla is used as a pick-me-up and an antidote to fevers. It is also attributed with aphrodisiac qualities, and is used in perfume production. Vanilla is one of the distinctive ingredients in the liqueurs Cr&egrave;me de Cacao and Galliano.\r\n<strong>Historical uses</strong>: It is not known when vanilla was first cured and used as a flavour, but the Aztecs had been fermenting the bean-like fruits to extract vanillin crystals many centuries before the Spanish first set foot in Central America in 1520.

ASTA colour value 32.11, Capsaicin value 0.226%, Scoville (&lsquo;heat&rsquo;) value ranges from 35,000 - 55,000 SHU.\r\n<strong>Native range</strong>: Central America, South America, Caribbean Islands\r\n<strong>Major producers</strong>: India, Thailand, Mexico, USA, South Korea, Turkey, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania\r\n<strong>Harvesting</strong>: Most chillies are grown as annuals and harvesting occurs about 3 months after planting. Green chillies are immature fruits and red chillies have been allowed to ripen for a further 4 weeks. Most of the chilli crop is dried, either in the sun or artificially.\r\n<strong>Taste and aroma</strong>: Chillies range in taste from mild and tingling to explosively hot. Large, fleshy varieties tend to be milder than small, thin-skinned ones. The characteristic pungency of chillies comes from the presence of capsaicin, which stimulates the digestive and circulatory processes.\r\n<strong>Culinary uses</strong>: Chillies can be used whole (fresh or dried), or in crushed or powdered form. Chilli powders are prepared from a variety of mild to hot chillies, and are typically milder than cayenne pepper. Crushed chilli (or chilli flakes) contains both the flesh and seeds from red chillies and can be used instead of chilli powder.\r\n<strong>Other uses</strong>: Oleoresins (a mixture of resin and oil) extracted from chillies contain capsaicin and are used in processed food. Capsaicin has counter-irritant properties and is used in pain balms and liniment. It is also the essential ingredient in pepper sprays used by law enforcement agencies.\r\n<strong>Historical uses</strong>: Use of this hot spice in Mexico is recorded as early as 7000 BC. Christopher Columbus took chilli plants back to Spain and from there they spread to Africa, India, and the Far East, where they quickly became an integral part of each cuisine.\r\n<strong>Storage</strong>: Fresh chillies keep in the refrigerator for a week or more. Dried chillies and chilli powder will keep almost indefinitely in an airtight container.\r\n','0.00','0.00','0.000',1,'','','','',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',0,0,'0.000'),(69,'CHILLI BIR WHO','Chillies - Birdseye','<strong>Botanical name</strong>: <em>Capsicum annum</em>, <em>Capsicum frutescens</em> â–ª Family name: <em>Solanaceae</em>\r\nChillies belong to the potato, tomato, and aubergine family of plants, and have been cultivated for thousands of years.

Although many attempts were made to introduce the plant elsewhere, vanilla remained exclusive to Mexico and the surrounding region until the 19th century. Vanilla flowers open for only one day and are naturally pollinated by the melipona bee and a particularly long-beaked species of hummingbird, both native to Central America which explained the lack of success in propagation elsewhere. Pollination of the plants in other regions where it is now grown successfully has to be done by hand.\r\n\r\n<strong>Native range</strong>: Central America\r\n\r\n<strong>Major producers</strong>: Mexico, Madagascar, India, Tahiti, Indonesia, Uganda, West Indies\r\n\r\n<strong>Harvesting</strong>: Vanilla pods are harvested when they begin to turn yellow. Further maturation is prevented by plunging them into boiling water. The pods then undergo a long curing process involving controlled heating, drying, and long storage during which the pods shrink to about 20% of their original weight and acquire a dark colour. During this process, enzymes cause a chemical change that produces aromatic compounds, notably vanillin.\r\n\r\n<strong>Taste and aroma</strong>: Fresh vanilla pods have no aroma or taste. After fermentation they develop a rich, mellow, intensely perfumed aroma with hints of liquorice. The flavour is delicate and sweetly fruity or creamy, occasionally with hints of raisin or prune.\r\n\r\n<strong>Culinary uses</strong>: Vanilla is used almost exclusively in sweet dishes and is a common ingredient in cakes, biscuits, and desserts. Whole or split pods can be used to flavour creams, custards, and ice cream. A whole vanilla pod that has been infused in a syrup or cream can be rinsed, dried, and reused.\r\n\r\n<strong>Other uses</strong>: Vanilla is used as a pick-me-up and an antidote to fevers. It is also attributed with aphrodisiac qualities, and is used in perfume production. Vanilla is one of the distinctive ingredients in the liqueurs CrÃ¨me de Cacao and Galliano.\r\n\r\n<strong>Historical uses</strong>: It is not known when vanilla was first cured and used as a flavour, but the Aztecs had been fermenting the bean-like fruits to extract vanillin crystals many centuries before the Spanish first set foot in Central America in 1520. The Spanish conquistadors drank chocolate flavoured with vanilla at the court of Moctezuma and took it back to Spain.\r\n\r\n<strong>Storage</strong>: Stored away from light in an airtight container, vanilla pods will keep for 2 years or more.','0.00','0.00','0.000',0,'','','','',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,'0.000'),(76,'PEPCOR GRE WHO','Peppercorns ~ Green','','0.00','0.00','0.000',1,'','','','',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',0,0,'0.000'),(77,'PEPCOR PIN WHO','Peppercorns ~ Pink','','0.00','0.00','0.000',1,'','','','',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',0,0,'0.000'),(78,'PEPCOR MIX WHO','Peppercorns ~ Mixed','','0.00','0.00','0.000',1,'','','','',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',0,0,'0.000'),(79,'MUSTAR BLA GRO','Mustard Ground ~ Black','<strong>Botanical name</strong>: <em>Brassica alba</em>, <em>B. juncea</em>, <em>B. nigra</em>  â–ª Family name: <em>Cruciferae</em>\r\nMustard is the seed of an erect, multi-branched herbaceous plant.\r\nDuring the Middle Ages mustard was introduced into Spain by Arab\r\ntraders, and it was soon carried throughout Europe.\r\n<strong>Native range</strong>: Southern Europe, Western Asia (black and yellow mustard); India (brown mustard)\r\n<strong>Major producers</strong>: India, Europe, North America\r\n<strong>Harvesting</strong>: Mustard is harvested by cutting the stalks when the\r\nseeds are fully developed but not quite ripe, to avoid the seed pods\r\nbursting and spilling their contents. The stalks are dried, then\r\nthreshed.\r\n<strong>Taste and aroma</strong>: Whole mustard seeds have little or no aroma.\r\nThe hot taste which gives mustard its &lsquo;bite&rsquo; is released only when the\r\nseeds are crushed or ground and mixed with water. This activates an\r\nenzyme present in the seeds, and it reacts with other natural\r\nconstituents to produce the essential oil which gives the\r\ncharacteristic taste.\r\n<strong>Culinary uses</strong>: Mustard is an indispensable ingredient in\r\ncooking. Yellow mustard seeds are used primarily as a pickling and\r\npreserving spice, and in marinades. Black and brown mustard seeds are\r\nused in India in curry powders and in spiced ghee (baghar or tadka).\r\nGround yellow mustard powder is used in salad dressing and mayonnaise,\r\nwhere it helps the emulsification of the egg yolk and oil.\r\n<strong>Other uses</strong>: Mustard is a stimulant and it is used to relieve\r\nrespiratory complaints and rheumatism. Mustard also used to be given as\r\na laxative and emetic.\r\n<strong>Historical uses</strong>: Mustard has featured in history and literature\r\nsince early times. Pythagoras suggested a mustard paste as a treatment\r\nfor scorpion stings.
